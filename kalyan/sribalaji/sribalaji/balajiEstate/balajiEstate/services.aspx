									<hr/>
									<p class="negative-margin">With most of middle class families entering into the mid to higher middle class band, more and more families are being able to contemplate buying a house. However, the city’s land has achieved a saturation point and there is very limited land to acquire and build a house. It is still cost prohibitive for most of the middle class families to build a house due to the soaring land value. Some of the courageous have decided to sprint out of the city to the periphery where the land is still reasonably priced. Within the last 10 years even the Hyderabad city after being a metro city now city outskirts have seen a steady increase in the cost of the land. This has created a great market for "Real Estate".<br />  Sri Sai Balaji Estates works with individuals who own a decent sized land and in  building an independent house at no cost to the owner. This provides an opportunity to the land owner to triple the value.</p>
