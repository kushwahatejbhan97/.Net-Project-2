		  <p class="big abs1">' I went to another institute before this one and I didn’t really care for the big class sizes. Here the classes are really small so you can get that one-on-one attention if you don’t understand the material. Faculties really care and are here to help you succeed.'</p>

		<p class="big abs1">' I feel AISM offered me the best opportunity for development of my skills in community interaction and development. I have found that the method of teaching is different from the one I am used to. Most of my courses have hands on aspect. AISM makes sure that the student is comfortable and progressing well in the programme and their life. My experience in AISM is possibly the most admirable moments of my life.'</p>

' Since the first moment I came to AISM I was met with nothing but energy and enthusiasm. The faculty and staff at this institution are top rate. They all want their students to do well. This institute has so many opportunities for the students to get the help they need… faculties helped me beyond words I can say. I really believe it is a privilege to come to this institute and I am so glad I made that decision.'</p>
