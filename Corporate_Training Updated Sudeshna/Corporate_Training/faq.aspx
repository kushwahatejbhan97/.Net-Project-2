            <div class="accordion-body">Executive coaches are professionals. They belong to a niche occupied by those among Learning & Development professionals who have specialization in working with people on a one-on-one basis for their individual development in the identified areas. While there are executive coaches who specialize in overall development of the coachee, others work in areas they have a specialty and competence in.

              <br/>
              <br/>

              Executive coaches do not normally advertise themselves by do go by references and endorsements of their work with others who have accessed and benefited from their association with the coach. Good coaches are known by the work they have done and the quality of the people they have coached.</div>

              What is the difference between Executive Coaching and other forms of coaching?

            <div class="accordion-body">The executive coach is one working on a one-on-one basis in helping senior and top executives in organizations with their L&D initiatives. Generally, Executive Coaching is a high-value initiative offered to critical and prized people resources at the higher levels of management. These executives have special needs considering they have lesser time and higher commitments with high stakes and investments riding on them. The executive coach covers a wide range of the L&D needs of the coaches. He has a wider repertoire of capabilities, tools and competencies he can call upon. Executive coaches normally work with individuals and with groups.
              <br>
              <br>

              On the other hand, other forms of coaching may focus on specific aspects of the needs of the people in the organiastiaon. They may have a narrow focus of specific skill or performance.</div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-item">

              How is and executive coach different from mentor?
            </button>
          </h2>
          <div id="flush-collapseThree" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="flush-headingThree" data-bs-parent="#accordionFlushExample">
            <div class="accordion-body">Both the executive coach and the mentor have a close association with the coachee and the mentee, respectively, they have the best interest of the coachee and the mentee at heart. The major focus of both is enhancing the effectiveness and success of their wards in performance and career.
              <br>
              <br>

              Having said these, there however exist distinct differences between the nature, practice and the duration of association of the executive coach with the coachee and the mentor with mentee. The relationship between them also is different as a consequence.
              <br>
              <br>
              
              The executive coach and the coachee have an association which is clearly driven by objective and purpose. The association between then is built around this. Therefore, the nature of the interactions and the scheduling of the interactions have a strong specific professional purpose and are less emotive. On the other hand, the association between the mentor and the mentee has a larger purpose of the overall development of the mentee in aspects not limited to the professional life and performance. The mentor has inspirational presence in the mentee’s mind and life, while the executive coach has professional role-based presence.</div>

            <div class="accordion-body">Guaranteeing that the problems can be solved is certainly a matter of prophesy without knowing anything about the problem itself. Therefore, whether in Executive Coaching or in any other profession that works with a measure of problem solving as a mandate, such guarantees are at best difficult to offer. However, on whether the coach can solve problems, it must be said that it is among the items on top of the list of work the coach is good at. Further, the coach really does not solve the problem, but helps coachee solve it himself in the true sense.

              <br>
              <br>

              The nature of the problem , the extent to which the coachee is willing to work at solving the problem, the time frame available and other environmental factors dictate whether the problem will be solved or otherwise. The dynamics between coachee and the coach also influence the approach to the problem itself. Eventually, it really depends on the coachee on how the problem will be approached, worked at and solved in the end. The executive coach is really the facilitator in the process.

            <div class="accordion-body">The realm of the coach is built around the professional work and performance of the coachee. However, particularly in the Indian context, it is not possible to contain the professional life within the bounds of office time. There is a significant leak of expectations, behaviors born in the familial settings into the workplace. So, also the intertwining of the personal life of the individual with his work-life entails that the coach must address the issues in personal life while working with the professional side of the coachee.
              <br>
              <br>

              However, some coaches prefer to refer the coachee to a counselor or similar expert in matters relating to the personal side of the coachee’s life.

            <div class="accordion-body">While it would be good to get an answer to this in ‘Yes’ or ‘No’, it would not be right to give either. It is akin to the way one would treat going to the medical doctor. Does one need to tell the doctor everything? May be not. But, ideally, one should let the good doctor know everything so that he can make an informed diagnosis and a better quality decision. So also it is with the coach.
              <br>
              <br>

              There is no norm or rule about everything being shared. And the coach himself will offer you the choice of not sharing something you may not want. But believing in the coach and establishing a relationship built on trust can help in taking the call on sharing everything with the executive coach a little easier.

            <div class="accordion-body">Trust and confidentiality are the cornerstones of the Coaching process. Every coach knows well that the key to establishing a successful relationship depends much on the faith the coachee has in the coach not only in terms of his capability and competence, but also in his adherence to the ethical values of the Coaching practice. The fundamental ethical value here is confidentiality. Therefore, you can trust thecoach with the information you share with him.

            <div class="accordion-body">Coaching does not have a standard one-size-fits-all routine. The duration of Coaching depends on how long it takes for the executive coach and the coachee to satisfactorily complete and achieve the objectives they have set for themselves. The objectives would include the development targets and the resolution of the issues facing the coachee.
              <br>
              <br>
              The normal period of engagement of the process would range from a few weeks to several months. Then again, the contractual engagement of the intervention could also determine the duration of the Coaching process.

Sometimes if there are more extensive discussions, inventories or experimental activities, the sessions may be extended further as may be necessary.
              <br>
              <br>

              Each session typically begins with the recap of the previous work to put the current session in a context and build a suitable environment for the session. Then it progresses into the discussion scheduled for the current session. This takes most of the time in the session. On completion of the discussion the coach takes stock of the progress in the process so far before looking at the work need to be done ahead. The coach then work with the coachee to look at the work that needs to be done in the intersession period before next session.

However, it is any body’s guess to assign how much value to intangible such as peace of mind, self-confidence, power to take actions etc. which comes naturally as an outcome of the coaching service.
